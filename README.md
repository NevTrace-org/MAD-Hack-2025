# Qubik Hackathon Project

This repository contains our submission for the Qubik Hackathon. The project is organized into several folders, each representing a key component of the system:

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- **`backend/`**  
  Contains the Web API developed with .NET 8.0. This is the backend of the application, which handles business logic and communicates with the frontend.

- **`frontend/`**  
  Contains the Nuxt-based frontend application. It interacts with the backend and provides the user interface.

- **`smart-contracts/`**  
  Contains the smart contracts developed for the project, specifically tailored for Qubik. It also includes deployment scripts that demonstrate how the contracts are deployed and used.

- **`screenshots/`**  
  A collection of screenshots showcasing different parts of the application, used for documentation and presentation purposes.
